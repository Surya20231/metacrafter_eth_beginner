# MyToken Contract

This Solidity program is a simple smart contract for a token called "MyToken". The contract allows for the creation of tokens, as well as minting and burning of tokens by the contract owner.

## Description

The MyToken contract is implemented in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract represents a basic token with functionalities to mint and burn tokens. It keeps track of token balances for different addresses and maintains a total supply of tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this contract, you will need the following:

- A development environment or IDE for Solidity, such as Remix or Truffle.
- Access to an Ethereum network for deployment and testing.

### Deployment

1. Copy and paste the contract code into a new file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `MyToken.sol`).

2. Compile the contract using your Solidity development environment or IDE, ensuring that the compiler version is between `0.8.0` (inclusive) and `0.9.0` (exclusive).

3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice, such as the mainnet, testnet, or a local development network. Make sure to specify the constructor parameters: `_name`, `_symbol`, and `initial_supply`.

4. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using its functions.

### Interacting with the Contract

The following are the main functions provided by the MyToken contract:

- `mint(address _address, uint256 _amount)`: Mints `_amount` tokens and assigns them to the specified `_address`.

- `burn(address _address, uint256 _amount)`: Burns `_amount` tokens from the specified `_address`.
